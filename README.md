# "Sign In App Companion" Companion

I keep forgetting to sign in the with [Sign In App Companion](https://signinapp.com/) when I go to work - I'd much rather my computer automatically sign me in when I turn it on and connect to the work network.

And no, I'm not giving the phone application location permissions.
